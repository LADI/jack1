Welcome to JACK, the Jack Audio Connection Kit.

This source codebase contains JACK-1 source code with
modifications related to LADI project (jackdbus).

jackdbus-related implementation sources are synchronized
to the 0.126.0 JACK-1 release. However the result is
not operational yet, as the work of removing jackdbus
specifics from this codebase and providing
the JACK Server Control API only,
for use by the dedicated LADI/jackdbus source repo,
is ongoing.

Please see the JACK [website](https://jackaudio.org/) and [wiki](https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki) for more information. 
There are also the #jack and #lad chat channels on [libera.chat IRC](https://web.libera.chat/#jack).
